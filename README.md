# Project Phoenix

## 📌 Description
Project Phoenix is a sample application created to demonstrate modern DevOps practices, including version control, automated builds, testing, and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

This project is used as a learning and practice platform for understanding how real-world software systems are developed, tested, and deployed safely.

## 🎯 Project Vision
The vision of Project Phoenix is to build a reliable, scalable, and maintainable software system by following industry-standard DevOps principles.

Our goals are:
- Maintain a clear and trusted code history using Git
- Automate builds and testing to reduce human errors
- Enable fast and safe deployments through CI/CD pipelines
- Ensure easy rollback and high system stability in production

Project Phoenix represents the idea of rebuilding stronger systems from scratch using automation, discipline, and best practices.
